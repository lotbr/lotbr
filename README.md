## 🧠 About Me

I'm Eduardo — a passionate programmer who truly *enjoys* coding.  
From crafting clean interfaces to building logical systems behind the scenes, I see programming as both art and logic — something that challenges me, excites me, and keeps me learning every single day.  

I love the process, the flow, and the feeling when things *finally work*.

## 🔧 What I Do

- 🎨 **Web Design** — turning ideas into modern and functional layouts.  
- 🧩 **Front-End Development** — HTML, CSS, and a touch of interactivity.  
- 🗄️ **Data Systems** — PHP & C# for the logic and backend side.  

My main goal is to create projects that look great, run smoothly, and solve real problems.
